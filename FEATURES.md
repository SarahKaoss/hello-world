SOME NEW FEATURES
=================

So here are the new features I shall be working on on this branch.  I hope they add to the usability, stability and security of the project, as well as helping me to come to understand how this all works better.

1. content checking
2. UX experience and accessability
3. bug-checks and testing
4. structural checks
5. spongebob squarepants and his friends
